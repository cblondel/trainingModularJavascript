Training module design pattern with Javascript

Our application is a simple yet fully functional image gallery application. The goal
is to present the users with a catalog of beautiful images on our site. Our site visitors
can click each of the images to see a full view of the image and add the images to
their favorite list of images, if they wish to do so.
The application will have a header, a navigation bar at the top, a main content area in
the middle, a footer, and of course a logo.
